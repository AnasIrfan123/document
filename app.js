// ==========================DIFFERENCE B/W MERN & MEAN=================================


what is the difference b/w MEAN & MERN Stack ?


Ans: The front-end framework is the primary difference between MEAN and MERN technology.
( MEAN stack uses Angular, while the MERN stack uses React ). Additionally, the MEAN stack
uses MongoDB as its database, while the MERN stack uses MongoDB or any other NoSQL database.
Both stacks use Node.  

MEAN Stack:

M: MongoDB
E: Express.js
A: Angular
N: Node.js
MERN Stack:

M: MongoDB
E: Express.js
R: React
N: Node.js


MEAN Stack:

MongoDB: A NoSQL database that stores data in a JSON-like format.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to build APIs and handle HTTP requests and responses.
Angular: A front-end JavaScript framework for building single-page client applications.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code server-side.
In the MEAN stack, MongoDB is the database layer, Express.js is used for server-side logic and routing, Angular is employed for client-side logic and UI rendering, and Node.js serves as the server runtime.

MERN Stack:

MongoDB: Same as in MEAN stack.
Express.js: Same as in MEAN stack.
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, commonly used for creating single-page applications.
Node.js: Same as in MEAN stack.
The main difference between MEAN and MERN is the front-end framework. While MEAN uses Angular, MERN uses React. React is a library for building user interfaces developed by Facebook, known for its component-based architecture and virtual DOM.
